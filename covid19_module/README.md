## Description

The COVID-19 module can be used to collect essential phenotypes associated with COVID-19 and MISC-related research, including: COVID-19 Exposure History; Symptoms and Signs; Comorbidities; COVID-19 Diagnoses and Treatments. The module is subdivided into core phenotypes (phenotypes incorporated from the H3Africa Standard) and COVID-19 &amp; MISC-specific phenotypes.
