## Description

The Infectious Disease toolkit can be used to collect essential phenotypes associated with Infectious Disease related research, including information related to Malaria, Trypanosomiasis / Sleeping Sickness, Tuberculosis (TB) and HIV.

## Phenotypes

Phenotype protocols contained in the toolkit are illustrated in the figure below:

## Administration

The phenotype protocols contained in the toolkit range from Interviewer/Self-administered questionnaires to clinically-administered and bioassay/lab-based assessments. The toolkit is applicable to human participants of all life stages, though some phenotype protocols are age-specific. For more information on administration of the toolkit, see the toolkit guideline.
