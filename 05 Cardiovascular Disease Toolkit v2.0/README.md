## Description

The Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) toolkit can be used to collect essential phenotypes associated with CVD related research, including; Anthropometrics, CVD History (Angina, Heart Attack, Congestive Heart Failure, Thyroid Disease) and more.  This document establishes guidelines (particularly applicable in Africa) on how to use the toolkit and collect detailed, relevant and harmonized phenotype and exposure data for research. 

## Phenotypes

Phenotype protocols contained in the toolkit are illustrated in the figure below:

## Administration

The phenotype protocols contained in the toolkit range from Interviewer/Self-administered questionnaires to clinically-administered and bioassay/lab-based assessments. The module is applicable to human participants of all life stages, though some phenotype protocols are age-specific. For more information on administration of the toolkit, see the toolkit guideline.
