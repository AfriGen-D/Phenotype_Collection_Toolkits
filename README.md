## Welcome to the Phenotype Data Collection Toolkits

**Our work**. 
A suite of easy-to-use data collection toolkits that cover a range of biomedical research fields. These toolkits provide data collection forms that can be used to build a research database and can facilitate phenotype standardisation and harmonisation efforts on the African continent and the larger user community. The standards can form the basis for data models for post hoc data harmonisation and also promote FAIR data principles, ultimately enabling data integration and interoperability.
The benefits of using these toolkits are multi-fold; 
(1) The toolkits are all aligned with existing, global data collection standards, 
(2) the toolkits are specifically adapted for biomedical phenotype data collection in Africa, and 
(3) the toolkits are highly interoperable, with variables mapped to existing and maintained ontologies.

The toolkits illustrated in **Figure 1** below (.xlsx data dictionaries; .xml redcap project templates; .pdf case report forms (CRFs) and .pdf toolkit guidelines) can be found under the corresponding folders.

**Figure 1.** Toolkit domains.

The developed sample CRFs can be used on the ground for paper-based data collection from participants, alongside the associated guidelines, whilst the XML templates imported directly into REDCap will set up a new project with the toolkit compiled and ready for use as a database for direct data capture or use in conjunction with the paper CRFs. The data dictionaries provide the necessary metadata for all the data elements/variables and can be imported into REDCap or replicated in your desired electronic data management platform. All the components of a given toolkit are illustrated in **Figure 2** below.
