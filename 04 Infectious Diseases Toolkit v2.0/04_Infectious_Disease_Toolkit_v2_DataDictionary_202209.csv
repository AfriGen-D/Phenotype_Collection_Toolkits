These ""genes"" are present in all of us and are the same in all parts of our bodies. ""Genes"" are sometimes also called DNA, which is the name of the material they are made from. Genes are responsible for why people in families are often more like each other, and different from other families. For example, some families are generally taller or shorter than others. This kind of information is passed from both the father and the mother to their children and on to their grandchildren, from one generation to the next. Some of these genes may prevent some people from getting certain illnesses. Other genes may be one of the reasons why some people get sick or have side effects from some medicines when others do not. We are still learning how genes might contribute to different diseases, and how they work together with our lifestyle and other factors - such as our environment or what we eat - to affect our health.
